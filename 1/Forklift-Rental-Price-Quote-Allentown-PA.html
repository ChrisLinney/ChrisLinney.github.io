<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>
<p>Manufacturers have models of rough terrain forklifts with load capacities ranging from 4000 to 10000 lbs. When unloaded, the forklift's center of gravity is right about here. We have 3 & 4 wheel electric sit down forklifts, stand up counterbalanced electric forklifts, propane powered, cushion tire warehouse forklifts, electric order pickers, stackers, rough terrain telehandlers and reach forklifts.</p>

<h3>Warehouse Forklift Types Allentown PA</h3>
<p>Counterbalance forklifts are most commonly used indoors in settings such as warehouses and retail spaces. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when load is raised to maximum lift height. Once you've found the right type of rough terrain forklift for your job site, the biggest decision you'll have to make is between renting and buying.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Free Lift = The vertical distance the forks can be raised before a mast begins to telescope. The forks, supported by the two front wheels, are raised hydraulically to lift the pallet. The hydraulic forks spread up to 2.22 metres gives excellent possibilities to handle long loads such as steel beams and plastic pipes but also conventional pallets. At Cat® Lift Trucks we design and build counterbalance forklift trucks for every application.</p>
