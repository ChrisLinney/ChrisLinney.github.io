The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>

Layman's Terms: Off-roading is fun, until you have to be towed 30 miles to a shop when your driveshaft falls out because you just had to have the huge lift. If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over. As time has passed, forklifts have tended to specialization.</p>
<p>The following are examples of Class III powered industrial trucks.
