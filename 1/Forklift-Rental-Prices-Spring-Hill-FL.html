The two basic types of lift kit are body lift and suspension lift. It should be noted that Lifted Trucks do have their drawbacks.

According to Manitou, cabs feature efficient heating and ventilation as standard, air conditioning (optional).” The company uses Shock Absorber Technology” designed to keeps the load stable in all types of terrain.</p>
<p>For the most part, trucks are made with body over frame” construction, which means that there is a basic metal frame for the truck and then the body of the truck is placed onto that frame and attached. As a result, with the adoption of advanced technology, there are substantial market opportunities, owing to the efforts of the manufacturers that are indulged in manufacturing forklift trucks that are technologically driven.</p>
