<p>Scenario: You're in the market for a new forklift in Indianapolis You know specifically that you need an electric lift truck with cushion tires that can lift loads up to 4,500 lbs. In 2018, the Chinese market maintained rapid growth, with the fork sales outnumbering 500,000 units in the first ten months of 2018 and expectedly approaching 600,000 units throughout the year.

<p>Adding a Pro Comp lift kit to your vehicle will help to maintain vehicle ride height, reduce the effect of shock forces, maintain wheel alignment, support loaded weight, and control the direction of travel for your truck or SUV. Often called a tugger,” these versatile machines are most commonly used for pulling loads from Point A to Point B rather than lifting.</p>

The truck class always sees a wide variety of entries due to a thriving community of truck enthusiasts with a broad palate for styling designs; from some of the lowest frame draggers you'll ever see to skyjacker lifts that seem to touch the sky. Double-Deep trucks are similar, but with longer forks, making them perfect for areas where multiple pallet loads are stored in each bay as they will reach right to the back of the bay.</p>

<p>Rough terrain forklifts can have a vertical tower, which lifts loads straight up, or a telescoping boom, which lifts loads up and out from the base of the machine. Maini's floor transportation range enables effortless transfer of heavy loads in your shop floors and warehouses. Motorized pallet jacks or manual pallet jacks are found in nearly every warehouse and are essential in many manufacturing and distribution work environments.</p>

The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
