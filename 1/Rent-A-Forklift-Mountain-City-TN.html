<p>Because extreme bounce can be a common problem in lifted trucks, we suggest continuously monitoring the bounce of your lifted truck. Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism. However, you will need basic numeracy skills and to be able to speak, read and write in English well enough to do the training and forklift driving licence test explained above.</p>

<p>Electric forklifts don't generate polluting emissions, and although they are usually the most expensive to buy, they are the cheapest in terms of operating costs. All operators are required to wear a harness while operating any order picker at any height. Heli is China's number one manufacturer of forklifts and 6th largest in the world.
