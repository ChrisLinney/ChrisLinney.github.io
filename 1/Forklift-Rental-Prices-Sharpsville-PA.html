PA Industrial Equipment has an extensive selection of high quality, dependable, economical used forklifts. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load at maximum elevation shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a slope of 4 percent about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
