When you book with us, you are booking with an experienced company with trainers that have had years of experience working in warehouses picking stock at all different heights on the order picker, trainers that have been safety representatives and store-men.

These kinds of lift kits are popular because no work is necessary to adjust the suspension or other mechanical systems on the truck. These forklifts feature a simple, cost-effective Tier 4 Final solution.</p>
