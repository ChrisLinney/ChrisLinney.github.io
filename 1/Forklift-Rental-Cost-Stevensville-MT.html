The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine. Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>

Conform with manufacturers requirements as per the operators handbook, other types of information source and relevant regulations and legislation.</p>

Today many business owners are meeting the tasks of material movement with the help of these hand pallet trucks. Courtesy Chevrolet does our lifted trucks in house so you know you are getting a great deal and a quality job done.</p>
