<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

<p>Speak to our representatives about finding the right lift truck and rental plan for your application. The most important part of choosing shocks for a lifted truck (besides knowing your truck's year, make, and model) is making sure you know the correct lift height. Linde offers a wide range of order picking equipment to suit all shelf heights, aisle widths, and order-picking methods.</p>
<p>Turret Trucks are battery operated machines that use both the electric engine, battery and operator compartment to counterweigh heavy loads. Additionally Pengate rentals offer the following advantages: low rates (which include batteries and chargers); rental rates may be expensible for tax purposes; maintenance service by our Raymond Certified Technicians at no added charge; the ability to opt into a rent-to-own program.</p>
<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>

Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>
<p>Enhanced off-road performance When you lift your truck you're getting more ground clearance which allows you to tackle more off-roading adventures. Moreover, the Motorised pallet truck we offer is quality approved and sturdy. They excel at having the best matched rental equipment for your application. These features ensure that the machines can move safely on loose ground, rocky areas, and uneven terrain.</p>
<p>The majority of fatalities stem from forklift turnovers, so an obvious advantage of pushing a cart as opposed to sitting in a vehicle is not going down with the ship, so to speak, if it slips off a loading dock or tips due to an unbalanced load.

In the UK, there are six approved training companies: Association of Industrial Truck Trainers (AITT), Independent Training Standards Scheme and Register (ITSSR), Lantra Awards , National Plant Operators Registration Scheme , Road Transport Industry Training Board (RTITB), Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).</p>

When you hear the name Nissan, you may think of cars and trucks, but the Japanese company is even more dominant in the lift industry. Safety standards implemented thoroughly can help keep workplace accidents at a minimum.</p>
