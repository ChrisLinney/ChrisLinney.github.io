Side Loader forklifts have been popular in the past as they were the first forklift designed specifically for long load handling.

<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg).
