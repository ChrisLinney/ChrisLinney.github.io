<p>Suspension lifts are also found on a number of high performance sports cars, in which a very low ground clearance is used to improve handling, using an aerodynamic effect known as downforce; examples include the Ferrari 488, Lamborghini Huracan, McLaren 720S, and the second generation Ford GT. Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
<p>With over 80 years' experience in the materials handling industry, we've developed a range of robust, efficient and performance enhancing forklift trucks and warehouse equipment; ensuring your applications are completed efficiently, safely and smoothly. Forklift capacities often range from 3,000 - 7,000 lbs, meaning you can load at least 1,600 lbs on your pallet with the order picker.</p>
