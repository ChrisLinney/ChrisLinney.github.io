We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

Courtesy Chevrolet does our lifted trucks in house so you know you are getting a great deal and a quality job done.</p>

A couple of other comments about Komatsu are important for all forklifts.

These types of forklifts are designed to run on a variety of fuel types, the most common being liquid propane and diesel.

<p>Our ranges of products like Standard Hand Hydraulic Pallet Truck are designed and developed using advanced technology and superior quality raw material. In the electric forklift, the battery acts partially as a counterweight which saves space. Designed to automatically lock the pallet for a secure grip, the Automatic Pallet Grip feature provides optimum control of the load.</p>

A parking brake (or mechanism) shall be provided and capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 15 percent grade, whichever is the lesser.

The dual-mode pantograph robotic reach truck is the first such model available in North America and joins Yale's well-established dual-mode robotic lift truck lineup. The Worldwide Industrial Truck Statistics (WITS) organization tracks quarterly and monthly statistics on lift truck sales and its report is compiled by six trade groups based in North America, Brazil, Japan, Korea, Europe and China.</p>
