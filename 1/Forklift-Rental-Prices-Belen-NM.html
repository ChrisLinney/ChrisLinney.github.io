Counterbalance forklifts are one of the most popular types of powered industrial trucks used today, and the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) requires counterbalance forklift training for any operator using this type of lift. If you need help choosing a suspension kit for your vehicle, or can't find the kit your looking for, contact one of our mechanics.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>As the hydraulic jack at the 'tiller' end is raised, the links force the wheels down, raising the forks vertically above the front wheels, raising the load upward until it clears the floor. If your employer deems this certification to be sufficient enough to operate the forklift safely and properly, they will grant you a license. The top supplying country or region is China, which supply 100% of all terrain forklifts respectively.</p>
