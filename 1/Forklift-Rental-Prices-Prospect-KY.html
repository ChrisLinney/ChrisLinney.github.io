<p>Simply put, a pallet jack is a large tool used to lift and move heavy pallets. Along with selling new and used forklifts, ProLift offers forklift rentals Using a rental is ideal when the need for a forklift is limited - as short as 1 day - or you have a sudden or unexpected need.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
