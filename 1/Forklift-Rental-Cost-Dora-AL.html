<p>SCA Performance RAM trucks are some of the most powerful and performance-ready lifted trucks in the industry. This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Many advantages exist for using reach trucks. From reach forklifts to warehouse forklifts or rough terrain lifts - you can rely on our top-tier material handling equipment.</p>

Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>
<p>There's a lot to love about lifted trucks but, simply put, they're not for everyone. Twin tube, monotube, and reservoir models are all available for anything you're taking on. For advanced off-roading rigs, we have you covered with shocks fitted for lifted suspensions as well as lift kits for DIY upgrades. Please note there will be an additional LO Licence processing fee payable to WorkSafe upon successful completion of your forklift training course.</p>
