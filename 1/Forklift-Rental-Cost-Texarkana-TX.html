<h2>Side Lift Truck Texarkana</h2>

Inquire about leasing any of our new and pre-owned or used forklifts. With our used forklifts, we can offer up to 36 months on a $1 buyout lease option. Forklifts vary in how high they can lift a load. Pneumatic tires: Designed for heavy-duty lifting and outdoor operation, a gasoline or diesel lift truck with pneumatic tires has the same functionality as a standard car or truck.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing. Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>

The largest of the "core" line of cushion trucks, the 15,500 lb. truck has the largest counterweight and the largest lifting capacity. Because of the additional weight from larger tires on your lifted truck, frequent oil changes are recommended when you lift your truck or SUV.</p>
