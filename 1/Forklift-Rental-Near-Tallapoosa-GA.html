Truck frame - the base of the machine to which the mast, axles, wheels, counterweight, overhead guard and power source are attached.</p>
<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>

In other cases, you may find that there are fellow lifted truck enthusiasts in the area who can provide you with additional information.</p>
