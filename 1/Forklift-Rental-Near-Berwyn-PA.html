<p>Canada and Mexico remain the two largest export countries for U.S. forklift manufacturers. Forklifts can provide a huge productivity boost to a facility by giving workers a powerful, flexible mobile platform for transporting and storing heavy materials. Operator Comfort- The Crown RR 5700 includes a suspended floorboard that absorbs vibration, and trucks can be outfitted with a ThermoAssist package for improved operator comfort in refrigerated or freezer applications.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
