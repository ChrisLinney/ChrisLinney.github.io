With breakthrough lift heights, capacities, visibility and energy savings, the Crown family of reach trucks can help you move and store materials efficiently.</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load.
