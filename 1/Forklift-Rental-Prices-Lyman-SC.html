<p>This early machine was used around construction sites and could lift about 1,000 pounds (454 kg) to a height of 30 inches (76 cm). Multi-Directional Forklifts are able to drive in all directions, allow for improved storage space and also prove significant increases in handling times.

The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
