<p>This early machine was used around construction sites and could lift about 1,000 pounds (454 kg) to a height of 30 inches (76 cm). Multi-Directional Forklifts are able to drive in all directions, allow for improved storage space and also prove significant increases in handling times. Body lift kits are typically constructed from plastic or polyurethane with a height of around 1 to 3 inches.</p>

The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
