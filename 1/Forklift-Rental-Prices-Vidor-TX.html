The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
<p>Our range of advanced low-level order pickers are designed for intensive picking in demanding environments. Please note: we only set up accounts for forklift traders and dealers. There's no substitute for experience, but a forklift simulator can prepare you and reduce the chances of making a mistake on the job. They may look simple, but rough terrain forklifts are complex machines with many parts.</p>
