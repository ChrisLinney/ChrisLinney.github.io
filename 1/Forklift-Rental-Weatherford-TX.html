A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck.

If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over. As time has passed, forklifts have tended to specialization.</p>
<p>A slight variation on the walkie rider pallet jack, the operator stands in the middle of a center-controlled rider pallet jack. Counterbalanced forklifts have been a source of storage and handling systems, where they perform loading, stacking, distribution and horizontal transport functions.

Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
