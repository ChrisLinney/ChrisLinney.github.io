<p>Looking to rent material handling equipment in Phoenix? These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude.

For instance, if a heavy load brings the center of gravity all the way to the front axle — the theoretical edge of the stability triangle — sudden braking could shift the load forward and out of the triangle altogether.</p>
<h2>Safe Pallet Racking Goodyear </h2>
<p>This practical training course is designed for existing fork lift truck operators who need to transfer their experience and skills towards the effective use of 4 Way Directional Reach trucks. Each Kit includes a set of "Load Leveling" Air springs specifically created to maximize load carrying capacity, ride quality, stability and overall braking control. As order pickers are mostly operated at elevated heights, it is important that operators are properly trained on maneuvering and safety of these trucks.</p>

Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust.

<p>All parts are made of stainless including hydraulic pump, fork frame, handle, push rod, bearing, pin, and bolt, etc. Warehouses and fulfillment centers with tall and deep racking commonly use reach trucks. You will also need to know what the required turning radius is, and also, the minimum aisle width the lift truck will be working in. This will determine the kind of forklift needed to be able to maneuver through the space in which the truck is working.</p>

Known for being highly versatile machines, these forklifts are capable of handling heavy loads from 2.5 tonnes up to 7 tonnes.</p>
