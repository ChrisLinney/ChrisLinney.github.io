<p>With so many different types of forklifts , your workplace efficiency and productivity depends on selecting the right equipment for your needs.

<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.).
