<p>The cost of renting a bucket truck will depend on the truck you're driving, the company, the working height, the geographical location and time you need it. The largest pricing factor, most of the time, will be the height limit. Most of the shipping firms now carry truck-mounted forklifts with them to easily off-load the construction products.

I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up. On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop.
