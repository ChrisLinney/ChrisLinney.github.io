<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well.

<p>So turn to Tynan, Indiana's largest forklift rental fleet, when you need to borrow a lift.
