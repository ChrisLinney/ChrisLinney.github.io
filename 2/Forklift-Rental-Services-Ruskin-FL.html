The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily.

The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
<p>Our range of advanced low-level order pickers are designed for intensive picking in demanding environments. Please note: we only set up accounts for forklift traders and dealers.
