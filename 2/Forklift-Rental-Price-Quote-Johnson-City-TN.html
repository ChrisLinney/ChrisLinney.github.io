On October 4, 2017, United Rentals announced it had acquired the assets of Superior Speedie Portable Services, Inc. With proper care and maintenance, a lifted truck provides many benefits for the off-road adventure seeker. We offer to our clients a Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck that has high load bearing capacity and is provided with nylon wheels for quiet and smooth rolling over rough surfaces.</p>

A 2000kg load can be sufficiently moved with some effort; however, with poor ground, a poor quality pallet jack, unstable loads, slopes, etc., it will be much more difficult for the pallet jack worker.</p>

The Rental Department of Raymond Storage Concepts strives to provide quality equipment and solutions to your short and long-term rental needs. The answer is similar to electric forklifts above. A walkie stacker forklift is designed for the operator to walk behind the truck and steer it through an attached handle.</p>
