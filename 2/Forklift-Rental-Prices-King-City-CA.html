<p>A lifted truck, often referred to as a 4x4 truck, is a modified vehicle specially designed for off road driving and other types of high-impact work.

In an effort to stand out but also fluently head off road and through disastrous weather conditions, we at Lewisville Autoplex Preowned suggest you try a custom lifted truck or Jeep vehicle.</p>

On double-end control baggage-type trucks or trucks which may be transported on short elevators, means should be provided to prevent unintentional folding of the operator's folding platform.</p>
