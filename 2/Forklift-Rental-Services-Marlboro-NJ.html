OSHA Section 1910.178 lists safety procedures for fork trucks, tractors, platform lift trucks, motorized hand trucks, and other specialized industrial trucks powered by electric motors or internal combustion engines.” The most important rule is that each forklift reaches the basic standards for safety.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>

<p>Navigating narrow warehouse aisles while working close alongside shelves and racks of products can expose operators to have counterbalance forklift license training.

Remember that the price of the equipment isn't the only cost you'll incur if you purchase a forklift.</p>

Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
<p>Due to this reason, we work hard to offer some cheap used lifted trucks for sale. Body lift kits are also typically the least expensive option when looking to lift a truck; however, a gap is created by the spacer between the body and frame.
