It may well be that you already know exactly what you want, in which case we will provide you with a quote.</p>
<p>Our versatile Furniture Orderpickers enable you to equip your truck with the ideal fork length with extended baselegs for rail guidance application; select from varying fork lengths ranging from 42-96 inches.

They have been renting out equipment for over 50 years.</p>
