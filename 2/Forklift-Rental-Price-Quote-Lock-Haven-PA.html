<p>Also, this rental service is available to us in many types at pocket-friendly rates. To operate an order-picking forklift truck you need an LO high risk work licence.

<p>If you need the best solution in material movement within your factory premises then a pallet truck will assist you well. Order picker trucks are types of lift trucks that are controlled from a carriage wherein the operator stance can be found.
