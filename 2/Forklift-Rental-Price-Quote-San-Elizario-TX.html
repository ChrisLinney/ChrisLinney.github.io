Like how its name says, the side loader forklift can drive up alongside pallet racks or other industrial shelving and can unload without having to turn.

Among all companies, Toyota Material Handling currently holds the highest portion of the lift trucks market share. If you own your own machinery, our team of qualified mechanics will ensure that your material handling equipment is reliable and in safe working order.</p>
<p>The forks on a reach truck are attached to a pantograph mechanism that extends them forward to place in or retrieve pallets from warehouse racking. Order pickers feature an elevating platform that brings the operator to the level of the stock, similar to a cherry picker. The extra-long frame combined with a larger counterweight means this model can handle larger loads.</p>
