American Luxury Coach, a true grassroots family business, is a marketplace leader in using state-of-the-art technology in manufacturing custom trucks and SUVs, customizing them to be off-road ready. Ask how this Fleet breaks down between long-term rental units and short-term rental units.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator stands, a vertical clearance of at least 74 inches should be maintained from the platform where he stands to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>
<p>The Raymond 7000 Series reach trucks are engineered for productivity in narrow aisle applications—handling small footprints and maximum throughput needs with over 200 configurations available. If low clearances are an issue, CASE offers freelift masts that allow you to raise the forks 5 ft off the ground prior to the mast protruding, keeping your overall travel height lower.</p>

<p>You can already see that lifted trucks have some real advantages when it comes to going off-road, thanks to the greater clearance they enjoy. Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model. Descriptive, task-oriented names (such as side loader, high-lift pallet” forklift) aside, forklifts are often referred to in more colloquial terms.</p>
<p>In addition to simply driving a fork lift, working as a fork lift operator requires the ability to properly lift, balance, and stack heavy loads that are ordinarily arranged on a wood pallet or a pallet made from other materials. They offer a streamlined credit approval process so you can rent forklifts (and other equipment, if needed) without paying the full price up front.</p>

In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
