<p>Keep your credit line clear - Unlike financing equipment, long-term rentals have little impact on your ability to borrow money to increase your business. Counterbalance forklift is characterized by its stability with the low center of gravity in its structure.

<p>Also, rough terrain forklifts are designed to last. Sudden malfunctions, seasonal fluctuations or an unexpected large-scale order: Remain flexible and rent exactly the forklift trucks you need at the time. Straddle trucks also have long forks to slide under the load, while they also have the ability to grip onto the edges for increased stability and ease of access.</p>
<p>The counterweight on these trucks juts out much further than the next size down, resulting in a longer truck. Use only approved industrial trucks in hazardous locations. Advancements in fuel technologies has led to a proliferation of different fuel types for standard similar sized forklifts including LPG, CNG and battery electric units. A truck with a lift kit has a higher center of gravity than a stock truck from the factory.</p>
