<p>Designed to increase productivity when handling heavy loads, the innovative and unique BT Pro Lifter model LHM230P requires up to 67% less force than a standard hand pallet truck to begin moving. Pallet jacks - also called order pickers, typical pallet jacks can lift approximately 3,300 pounds. Dayton® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
<p>Usually they can reach heights up to 390″ Order pickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries. You can also use an electric forklift outdoors. Many lifted truck stores put lifts on high mile trucks, and this can lead to a poor ride and other issues that are associated with lifted vehicles.

<p>LP engines, propane, diesel forklifts and more. Choosing the right forklift is important for your business. That also means you can take your lifted truck off the beaten path and drive it hard.

Typically the billing cycle for a forklift rental is monthly, but daily billing or weekly billing is available depending on the rental period and requirements of the renter. Essentially two branches of the same tree, narrow aisle and very narrow aisle forklifts are further enhanced through swing mast and turret truck operation.</p>
