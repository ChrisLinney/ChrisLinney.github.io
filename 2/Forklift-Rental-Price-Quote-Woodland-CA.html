<p>Forklift types vary in several aspects, from their fuel type and tire composition to their lift capacity and height.

<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail. Customization and accessories for trucks go beyond what the manufacturer offers on brand new models, however, giving truck drivers even more freedom to make their pickups their own.
