<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>Our forklift hire & rental equipment is selected, prepared and maintained for the huge short-term forklift rental fleet available from Linde's national branch and dealer network. Reliability of used forklifts: Purchasing a used forklift will set you at ease because it was thoroughly demonstrated in its previous workplace. Click on the Capacity category below to view all the makes and models of Pneumatic Used Forklifts.</p>

<p>Licensing prerequisites are the same for both conventional and rough terrain forklifts. If at any time a powered industrial truck is found to be in need of repair, defective, or in any way unsafe, the matter shall be reported immediately to the designated authority, and the truck shall be taken out of service until it has been restored to safe operating condition.</p>
<p>Application Hydraulic hand pallet truck is widely used in various industries to lift loads. Altorfer Lift Truck is proud to be a member of the Material Handling Equipment Distributors Association (MHEDA).

<p>Shall be located with the center of gravity centered 10 inches above the compressed operator's seat for sit-down trucks and centered 40 inches above the operator's platform for stand-up trucks. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when the load is raised to maximum lift height.</p>

Three-Wheel Counterbalance - These forklifts feature three wheels as opposed to four in their counterbalance forerunners. Compare that to any other body style of any car or truck from the ‘90s and it looks outdated and ugly.</p>
<p>Our friendly staff will work with you closely to better understand your operations and requirements, and help you choose the right forklift. Forklifts were first invented during early part of the 20th century and now had become a vital part of the modern-day industrial world. Their high capacity of up to three tons and easy manoeuvrability in tight spaces make hand pallet trucks the perfect warehouse aid.</p>

We also provide safety training classes that meet OSHA guidelines for forklift operation. With this new generation of straight-mast forklifts, there are plenty of options to choose from. The degree of suspension lift you opt for makes a huge difference while driving on the roads of Conway, Georgetown, and Florence.</p>
