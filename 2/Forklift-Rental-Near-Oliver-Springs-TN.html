H&E were founded in 1961 and have been providing equipment rental for more than 50 years.

With a VR educational tool, operators can become more comfortable with all aspects of lift truck operation—from learning the controls to knowing how to navigate emergency scenarios,” says Comfort.</p>
<p>As the hydraulic jack at the 'tiller' end is raised, the links force the wheels down, raising the forks vertically above the front wheels, raising the load upward until it clears the floor. If your employer deems this certification to be sufficient enough to operate the forklift safely and properly, they will grant you a license. The top supplying country or region is China, which supply 100% of all terrain forklifts respectively.</p>

Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck.
