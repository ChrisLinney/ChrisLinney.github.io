Outdoor forklifts use pneumatic tires with deep treads and more ground clearance to make them easier to drive on rough terrains.

<p>For others, it's the enhanced functionality and driver satisfaction that makes these trucks attractive choice.

Toyota forklifts are designed and manufactured from the ground up with operator safety, comfort, productivity and efficiency in mind.</p>

As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
