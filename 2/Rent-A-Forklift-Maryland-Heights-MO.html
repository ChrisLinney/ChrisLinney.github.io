They also invest heavily in the design of their machines to ensure optimal performance even on jobsites that include limited access terrain and high-reach areas. The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L").</p>
