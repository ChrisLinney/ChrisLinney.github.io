This type of forklift is suited for uneven surfaces with its sturdy pneumatic tires.

<p>An authorized Cat® dealership with over 80 years of industry experience servicing businesses across the region, Holt of California specializes in addressing the rental needs of our clients. Get the right forklift equipment for your next project. If your employees will be expected to operate several different types of powered industrial trucks, then training is required on the unique handling characteristics of the vehicles.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>

<p>However, only the forklift truck manufacturer can give accurate lifting capacities. Lifted trucks look right at home on any beach, and their increased performance makes traversing sand more satisfying than an ocean breeze. Our forklift trucks are dependable and reliable to get to the job done in a safe and efficient manner. With the test load supported by the forks in a normal and unrestrained manner and the mast at full rearward tilt permitted by the truck mechanism at that elevation, elevate the load to its maximum height.</p>

While the dealer insures the equipment, you'll want to make sure your company's insurance covers the operator, other people at your facility and the facility in the event of an injury or property damage when the rented forklift is in use.</p>
