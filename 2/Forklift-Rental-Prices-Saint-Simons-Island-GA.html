Due to the presence of the boom lift, this machine is considered a partially loaded truck even without a load on the attachment.</p>

Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
